      Directories and files to ignore when checking changes to determine whether functional
      tests should be skipped. This is an optional input field and it accepts a regex string.
      The paths should be relative to the repo's root directory.
      Examples:
      - "^(README.md|doc/|tests/unit/)"
    default: "^$"
  last-workflow-file:
    required: false
    description: "The file that triggered previous workflows"
    default: "pr.yaml"
  last-workflow-wait-minute:
    required: false
    description: "The max waiting time in case the last workflow is still in progress"
    default: 60
